<p>In this lecture, we will see a few beautiful things about the building blocks of the Brauer group, the algebras themselves. A bunch of the proofs here are inspired by (or cribbed from) the beautiful book by Farb and Dennis on non-commutative algebra.</p>

<p>In studying division algebras, we are naturally led to apply one of Rumsfeld’s famous rules: “If you can’t solve a problem, make it bigger.” (He was <em>very</em> good at this.)</p>
<p>One of the deepest insights of 20th Century mathematics is the observation that rather than investigate the inner workings of a single object, it often pays to investigate associated categories. We usually think this means that we should look at the category of objects of a similar flavor, but “classical” algebra gives us a prime example this idea, due to Morita theory. I will not go into detail about Morita theory, except for its incarnation in our specific case.</p>
<h3 id="simple-categories-and-matrix-rings">Simple categories and matrix rings</h3>
<p>Call an abelian category <span class="math">\(C\)</span> <em>simple</em> if is semisimple and there is a simple object <span class="math">\(c\)</span> in <span class="math">\(C\)</span> such that every object of <span class="math">\(C\)</span> can be written as a direct sum of copies of <span class="math">\(c\)</span> (up to isomorphism).</p>
<div class="theorem">
(Morita-ish) Fix an Artinian ring <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. The category of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>-modules is simple if and only if <span class="math">\(A\cong M_n(D)\)</span>, the ring of matrices over a division ring <span class="math">\(D\)</span>.
<div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. If the category is simple, then we can write <span class="math">\(A\)</span> itself as <span class="math">\(c^{\oplus n}\)</span> for some natural number <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. But then <span class="math">\(A\)</span> (acting on the right) is the ring of endomorphisms of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> as a left <span class="math">\(A\)</span>-module, while we can also compute this endomorphism ring as <span class="math">\(M_n(\End(c))\)</span>. By Schur’s lemma, <span class="math">\(\End(c)\)</span> is a division ring. QED</p>
<p>Why do we care?</p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong>. Exercise! (Too hard?) QED</p>
<h3 id="the-artin-wedderburn-theorem">The Artin-Wedderburn Theorem</h3>
<p>There is an amazing result governing the Artinian rings with simple module categories: they can be characterized algebraically!</p>
<p>Recall that a ring is <em>simple</em> if it has no non-trivial two-sided ideals.</p>
<div class="theorem math">
<dl><dt class="math">Theorem 2</dt>
<dd class="math">
(Artin-Wedderburn, special case) An Artinian ring <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is simple if and only if the module category <span class="math">\(\Mod_A\)</span> is simple.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. If the module category is simple, we have just seen that <span class="math">\(A\cong\M_n(D)\)</span>, and it is an exercise that this ring is simple. (Just do linear algebra over a division ring! More precisely, why not classify all ideals – left, right, two-sided – in these rings while you’re at it?)</p>
<p>So suppose that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a simple Artinian ring. First, given an <span class="math">\(A\)</span>-module <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, note that the annihilator of any element is a two-sided ideal of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> that does not contain <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, hence is trivial. A minimal left ideal of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> (which exists because <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is Artinian!) is a simple module, so, in particular, <span class="math">\(A\)</span> has a faithful simple module that we will also call <span class="math">\(M\)</span>. We will show that in fact <span class="math">\(A\)</span> can be written as <span class="math">\(M^{\oplus m}\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(m\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is a clever trick: a map <span class="math">\[f:A\to M^{\oplus n}\]</span> with minimal kernel must be injective. Indeed, if not, there is some <span class="math">\(a\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(f(a)=0\)</span>. But <span class="math">\(M\)</span> is faithful, so there is an <span class="math">\(m\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(am\neq 0\)</span>. We can thus create a new map <span class="math">\[f&#39;:A\to M^{\oplus n}\oplus M\]</span> by sending <span class="math">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math">\((f(a), am)\)</span>. This will have a smaller kernel!</p>
<p>Now that we have an injection <span class="math">\(A\inj M^{\oplus n}\)</span> into a direct sum of simple modules, it is an entertaining exercise to show that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> itself must be isomorphic to <span class="math">\(M^{\oplus m}\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(m\)</span>. Using the argument from above, this means that <span class="math">\(A\cong M_n(D)\)</span>, as desired. QED</p>
<h3 id="central-simple-algebras-1">Central simple algebras</h3>
<p>Fix a field <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<div class="definition math">
<dl><dt class="math">Definition 3</dt>
<dd class="math">
A <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-algebra <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is called a <em>central simple algebra</em> if <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is finite-dimensional over <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, has center <span class="math">\(k\cdot 1\)</span>, and is simple.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>By the above, any central simple algebra <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is isomorphic to one of the form <span class="math">\(M_n(D)\)</span> for a central division algebra over <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Putting everything together, the objects making up the Brauer group – the central division algebras <span class="math">\(D\)</span> – have the same module categories as the central simple algebras.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we care??</strong></p>
<p>Because of the following awesome result.</p>
<div class="proposition math">
<dl><dt class="math">Proposition 4</dt>
<dd class="math">
If <span class="math">\(A\)</span> be a central simple algebra over <span class="math">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math">\(L\)</span> is a field extension of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(A\tensor_k L\)</span> is a central simple algebra over <span class="math">\(L\)</span>.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. Centrality: the condition that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is central can be written like this. There is a natural map <span class="math">\(\alpha:A\to \Hom(A, A)\)</span> that sends <span class="math">\(a\)</span> to the map sending <span class="math">\(b\)</span> to <span class="math">\(ab-ba\)</span>. The center is precisely the kernel of this map. By flatness of everything over a field, if <span class="math">\(k\to A\)</span> identifies <span class="math">\(k\)</span> with <span class="math">\(\ker(\alpha)\)</span>, the same is true of <span class="math">\(L\to A\tensor_k L\)</span>.</p>
<p>Simplicity: the key here is the following amusing claim.</p>
<p><strong>Claim</strong>. Any non-zero two-sided ideal <span class="math">\(J\)</span> of <span class="math">\(A\tensor_k L\)</span> has non-zero intersection with <span class="math">\(L\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. (Farb and Dennis, Lemma 3.7) Choose <span class="math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="math">\(J\)</span> that has an expression <span class="math">\(x=\sum a_i\tensor\lambda_i\)</span> with minimal length. This implies that the <span class="math">\(\{a_i\}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\{\lambda_i\}\)</span> are linearly independent over <span class="math">\(k\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(a_1\neq 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is simple, we have that <span class="math">\(Aa_1A=A\)</span>, so there are <span class="math">\(x_j, y_j\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\sum x_j a_1 y_j=1\)</span>. This means that <span class="math">\[x&#39;:=\sum_j x_j\tensor 1\left(\sum_i a_i\tensor\lambda_i\right)y_j\tensor 1=\sum_i a_i&#39;\tensor\lambda_i\]</span> is also in <span class="math">\(J\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(a_1&#39;=1\)</span> (so, in particular, <span class="math">\(x&#39;\neq 0\)</span>). For any <span class="math">\(a\in A\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\[(a\tensor 1)x&#39;-x&#39;(a\tensor 1)=\sum_{i\geq 2}(aa&#39;_i-a&#39;_ia)\tensor\lambda_i\]</span> (as <span class="math">\(a&#39;_1=1\)</span>, so it is central). But <span class="math">\(x\)</span> had minimal length, when we conclude that <span class="math">\(aa&#39;_i=a&#39;_ia\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is central, we have that each <span class="math">\(a_i&#39;\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, whence <span class="math">\[x&#39;=\sum 1\tensor a&#39;_i\lambda_i\in 1\tensor_k L,\]</span> as desired. QED the claim.</p>
<p>Conclusion: any non-zero two-sided ideal <span class="math">\(J\)</span> contains <span class="math">\((J\cap L)\cdot A\tensor L\)</span>, which is <span class="math">\(A\tensor_k L\)</span>. But then any non-zero two-sided ideal is the whole ring, as desired. QED</p>
<div class="corollary math">
<dl><dt class="math">Corollary 5</dt>
<dd class="math">
Any central simple algebra <span class="math">\(A\)</span> over <span class="math">\(k\)</span> has the property that <span class="math">\(A\tensor\overline k\cong M_n(\overline k)\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. In fact, this is true over the <em>separable closure</em> of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. The last statement: the scheme of isomorphisms between <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(M_n\)</span> is smooth and non-empty, hence has a point over a separable extension. QED</p>
